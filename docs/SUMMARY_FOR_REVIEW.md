## Current Situation

### What Works ✅
- API authentication
- Category/Collection creation (6 created successfully)
- Listing existing KB items
- Content parsing and transformation
- 673 documents ready to migrate

### What's Blocked ❌
- Article creation fails with "Internal Server Error"
- Issue is specifically with the `visibility` field
- Tried 15+ different configurations
- All attempts result in the same error

## The Core Problem

The SuperOps API requires a `visibility` field when creating articles, but:
1. The field is marked as required in the schema
2. Every format we try causes an internal server error
3. No documentation exists on the correct format
4. We can't query for account/client IDs that might be needed

## Next Steps

1. **Review the documents** - Check `email_to_superops.md` before sending
2. **Send the email** with `superops_migration_debug.zip` attached
3. **Key points to emphasize** in any calls:
   - We CAN create categories successfully
   - The ONLY issue is the visibility field for articles
   - We need ONE working example of article creation

## Technical Details for Your Reference

**What we're sending (fails):**
```json
{
  "input": {
    "name": "Test Article",
    "content": "<p>Content here</p>",
    "parent": {"itemId": "7986891993049776128"},
    "status": "PUBLISHED",
    "visibility": {
      "added": [{
        "portalType": "TECHNICIAN",
        "userSharedType": "AllUsers"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**What SuperOps expects (unknown):**
- Maybe specific account/client IDs?
- Maybe different enum combinations?
- Maybe the field can be omitted somehow?
- Their dev team needs to provide guidance

## Files for Your Review

## Migration Tool Status

The tool itself is production-ready and includes:
- Async batch processing
- Progress tracking with resume capability
- SQLite state management
- Error recovery and retry logic
- Content transformation pipeline
- Organization-based categorization

**We just need SuperOps to tell us the correct visibility format for article creation.**
